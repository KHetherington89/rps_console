This game was created as part of The Odin Project fundamentals, on the assignment
Rock Paper Scissors, and the subsequent revisit. 
It has gone far beyond the project brief in order to practice skills learned 
up to this point.
Rather than playing just rock paper scissors, it plays Rock Paper Scissors
Lizard Spock. In addition to this it also describes how each winning choice 
beats the loser.
The game plays first-to-five, and can then be reset by a player button to play 
again.

All code is my own, but naturally with inspiration from MANY places.
All icons are also my own.
Game font is "Atomic Age" from fonts.google.com
