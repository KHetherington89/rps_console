Rock Paper Scissors for the dev console

This project was created as part of the Javascript fundamentals section of The Odin Project. 
The aim was to practice skills learned so far in Javascript as well as looking up new things.

The game plays out entirely through prompts and alerts, and should only accept rock, paper, or scissors as input, ignoring any capitalisation.
The game plays first to 5 before ending.
